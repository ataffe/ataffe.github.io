whoami: I was born in sunny California but grew up in Yuma, Arizona. 
        I spent 4 years in the U.S. Army as a radio operator stationed at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska! After serving in the military,
         I spent 1 year back in Yuma at Arizona Western College then transferred to Arizona State University where I majored in Computer Systems Engineering.
          After graduating, I worked as a software engineering for 5 years across various industries including aerospace, fintech, and law enforcement technology in Phoenix, Arizona, San Jose, California, and San Francisco, California.
           I've always been interested in computer vision after working on a project at ASU, and I got the opportunity to formally learn more about not just computer vision but also machine learning and deep learning at UC Davis through a masters degree program. 
           At UC Davis I also got the opportunity to work on an exciting research project applying computer vision to a <a href="../projects/index.html">fluorescence lifetime imaging based surgical navigation system</a> with the <a href="https://marculab.bme.ucdavis.edu/">marcu lab</a>! 
           This experience along with my formal courseworkreally sparked my interest in research and developing better computer vision models that in general can help improve people's lives.

whatido: I design and build backend web services and computer vision systems most recently using modern technologies and best practices. My work focuses on creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions that solve real-world problems.

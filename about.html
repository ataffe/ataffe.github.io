<div class="content">
    <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm Alexander Taffe, a software engineer passionate about designing and building robust, scalable, maintainable backend web services and computer vision based systems.</p>
    
    <h2 class="title is-3">Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I was born in sunny California but grew up in Yuma, Arizona. I spent 4 years in the U.S. Army as a radio operator stationed at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska! After serving in the military, I spent 1 year back in Yuma at Arizona Western College then transferred to Arizona State University where I majored in Computer Systems Engineering. After graduating, I worked as a software engineering for 5 years across various industries including aerospace, fintech, and law enforcement technology. I've always been interested in computer vision after working on a project at ASU, and I got the opportunity to formally learn more about not just computer vision but also machine learning and deep learning at UC Davis through a masters degree program. At UC Davis I also got the opportunity to work on an exciting research project applying computer vision to a <a href="../projects/index.html">fluorescence lifetime imaging based surgical navigation system</a>! This experience along with my formal courseworkreally sparked my interest in research and developing better computer vision models that in general can help improve people's lives.
